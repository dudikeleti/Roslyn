# Roslyn


I'll add here some plays that I make with Roslyn.

1 - Rewriter that take query comprehension syntax and rewrite it to corresponding fluent syntax.

This is a sub class of a bigger class that do the rewrite, among other things.
Hence, it may be that part of the code will seem redundant.
I kept the query as is, without removing any redundant parts.

2 - Rewrite that take an instance method and convert it to a static method
