# Roslyn


I'll add here some plays that I make with Roslyn.

The first thing is rewriter that take query comprehension syntax and rewrite it to corresponding fluent syntax.

In this sample, I did not did any syntax validation. Also I kept the query as is, without removing the redundant parts, and I didn't handle the join clause.

This is just a sample so if you want to use it, test it.
